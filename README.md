Interpreting user needs are as simple as listening to what they tell you. Also, a little intuition goes a long way in imagining what a user may want to get out of a particular system. Creating user stories greatly helps with this task by carving a larger story into bits and chapters. 
I would approach developement of programs by first interpreting the needs of the client and shaping the framework from there. These will no doubt become the behaviors of the system. Having learned quite will about the Scrum approach this term, it would be hard to argue against it. 
Being a good team member is all about openness and being able to communicate well. The skill to socialize effectively is invaluable when collaborating amongst a team.
